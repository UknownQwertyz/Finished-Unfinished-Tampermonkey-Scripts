With my ending coming soon, i would like to post all of my scripts that i have worked on over the past half of a decade

although i still would like to bring scripts to my community

i can no longer due to life issues and the loss of motivation because i'm a one man army and i cant make huge scripts without them taking days to make

and the use of AI is very unreliable and very cheap

i hate it.

i just wish it wasnt so hard to make intresting/useful scripts

although i am fairly new to coding

i still have big ambitions

if anyone sees this and would like to finished my unfinished scripts

feel free

i no longer have any use for them

and to anyone who finishes one of my scripts

i will post finished scripts on Greasyfork.com

my username on there is UnknownQwertyz

i post my scripts on there, but due to me having a github account

i figured why not post my tampermonkey scripts

hopefully someone finds these to be useful as i have

goodbye.
